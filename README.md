Feel free to contact me if you have any questions on my work, or just want to talk about all things bicycle related.

The website will gradually fill up with new stuff... or be totally redone... or just be the same for a long time...

## Update as of 09.10.23
Now this site is updated to Astro v3. And some other stuff, hopefully... probably.
